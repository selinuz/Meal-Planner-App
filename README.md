# Meal Planner

## A meal planner and a grocery list maker according to the recipes you know how to make

Meal Planner will be an application where you can put in the 
recipes you know how to make and plan your meals for the week. After 
creating your weekly meal plan, you will also be able to generate a grocery
list according to the ingredients you are going to need. This app will be useful
to anyone who needs to shop for groceries and cook. As a young adult who recently
started living alone, figuring out what to cook each week and what to buy is a
hassle for me. By making this application, I will also be creating a way that will
make my life easier.
